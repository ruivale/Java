  //Philosphers eat chickens.  They queue up at the canteen to use the `get'
  //method.  Inside the `get' method, they get served straight away so long
  //as there are some chickens ready.  Otherwise they `wait' on stand-by.
  //
  //The chef cooks chickens.  When he has a batch ready, he also queues up
  //at the canteen in order to use the `put' method.  This involves setting
  //down the batch -- which takes around 3 seconds -- and clearing the stand-by
  //queue (of philosophers waiting for chickens) by calling `notifyAll'.
  //
  //{{{  note 1
  //
  //Clearly, the Chef should not have to queue up with the Philosophers to
  //get into the Canteen.  The Philosophers should have their own queue and
  //the Chef should only have to contend with one Philospher when dealing with
  //the chickens in the canteen.  Such a separate queue for the Philosophers is
  //just like the seperate queues for readers/writers that we needed for the
  //securely shared Channel or Buffer class.  However, we are modelling this
  //Canteen on the CubbyHole class (to show the danger of starvation it contains)
  //and CubbyHole has its queue shared by both readers and writers.
  //
  //}}}
  //
  //{{{  note 2
  //
  //All methods, apart from the `run' method, are executed as part of the thread
  //of control of their calling objects.  This is particularly clear here, where
  //we see them speaking *as* those calling objects.  For instance, the `get'
  //method is part of the life of the calling Philosopher and `put' is part of
  //the life of the Chef.  So, this Canteen "object" has bits of Philosopher-
  //algorithm and bits of Chef-algorithm for its methods -- a somewhat confused
  //set of roles for something that's supposed to be a Canteen.  There's nothing
  //in these methods that are oriented towards the life of the Canteen.
  //
  //So, alongside the semantic imprecision of `wait/notify' and alongside the
  //non-compositional (or, if you prefer, non-referentially-transparent) semantics
  //of methods in general, we have to come to terms with the idea that no methods
  //(apart from `run') are oriented towards the "objects" of which they are
  //supposed to be a part.  So much for "object-orientation" in the formal, and
  //quite arbitrary, definition of the term!  I believe that the first two
  //problems referenced in this paragraph are a direct consequence of the third.
  //These problems are not special to this Canteen, but are universal across
  //all passive objects.
  //
  //The Canteen should, of course, be implemented as an active object connected
  //to the Philosophers and the Chef via simple channels or buffers.  Then, we
  //wouldn't have the problems arising from this design.  This is left as an
  //exercise!
