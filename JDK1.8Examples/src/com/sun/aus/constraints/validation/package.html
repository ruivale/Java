The key class in this package is 
{@link com.sun.aus.constraints.validation.ValidatableObject ValidatableObject},
which provides the validation services for the framework. Individual constraints
are validated via implementations of the
{@link com.sun.aus.constraints.validation.ConstraintValidator ConstraintValidator}
interface.
These constraint validators are registered (for the constraint types that they will
validate) in the
{@link com.sun.aus.constraints.validation.ValidatorFactory ValidatorFactory}.
