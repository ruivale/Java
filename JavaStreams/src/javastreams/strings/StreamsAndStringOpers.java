/**
 * <p>
 * Description: In this quick article, we would learn how to use the Stream API to split a
 * comma-separated String into a list of Strings and how to join a String array into a
 * comma-separated String.
 *
 * We'll also look at how to convert a string array to map using Stream API.
 *
 * Nearly all of the time we face situations, where we need to iterate some Java Collections and
 * filter the Collection based on some filtering logic. In a traditional approach for this type of
 * situation, we would use lots of loops and if-else operations to get the desired result.
